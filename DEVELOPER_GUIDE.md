# Developer Guide (Pointer)

Use the backend guide. It is the source of truth.

- Backend developer guide: `custom-widget/backend/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`
- API docs: `custom-widget/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` and `custom-widget/CONVERSATION_API.md` (moving to OpenAPI at `custom-widget/backend/openapi.yaml`)
- Architecture: `custom-widget/backend/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `custom-widget/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`

This file is intentionally minimal to avoid duplication.
