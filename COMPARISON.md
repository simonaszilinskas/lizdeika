## Decision Framework

Ask yourself:

1. **Do you need email support?**
   - Yes → Freescout
   - No → Custom Widget

2. **How many agents?**
   - 1-2 → Custom Widget
   - 3+ → Freescout

3. **Budget constraints?**
   - Tight → Custom Widget
   - Flexible → Either

4. **Time to launch?**
   - ASAP → Custom Widget
   - Weeks okay → Either

5. **Technical expertise?**
   - Limited → Freescout
   - Strong → Either

## My Recommendation

**Start with the Custom Widget** because:
1. You can launch in days, not weeks
2. Test AI support with real users quickly
3. Learn what features you actually need
4. Migrate to Freescout later if needed
5. Total cost under $50/month

The custom widget gives you 80% of the value with 20% of the complexity.
