MANUAL CLEANUP REQUIRED
=======================

Run the following command to remove cookie-parser from package-lock.json:

    cd custom-widget/backend
    npm install

This will regenerate package-lock.json without cookie-parser entries.

Why: cookie-parser was added to package-lock.json but removed from package.json.
The dependency is not used (authentication uses localStorage, not cookies).

After running npm install, delete this file.
